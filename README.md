# Ruby Language Syntax Validator

This Ruby Language Syntax Validator is a tool built using Lex (or Flex) and Yacc (or Bison) to validate the syntax of Ruby code snippets. It focuses on key constructs, including function definitions, set definitions, switch statements, variable declarations, and while loops. The validator checks for syntax errors and provides feedback to assist users in writing correct Ruby code.

## Features

- **Function Definition Validation:** Ensures that function definitions follow proper syntax.
- **Set Definition Validation:** Checks the correctness of Ruby set definitions.
- **Switch Statement Validation:** Validates the syntax of switch statements.
- **Variable Declaration Validation:** Ensures variable declarations are syntactically correct.
- **While Loop Validation:** Checks the correctness of while loops.
